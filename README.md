# <div align="center">COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: Regression and PCA</div>  
  

#### <div align="center">The project links mortality data with socioeconomic factors. 
It seeks to understand the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. For this, we will do a regression analysis and a PCA to understand the impact of socioeconomic factors on the mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 in the different Brazilian states. </div>  
  

- Cluster Analysis  
  

- Linear Regression  
  

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
